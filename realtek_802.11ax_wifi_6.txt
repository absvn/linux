## Realtek RTL8852AE WiFi 6 802.11ax PCIe Adapter

Now that you have installed the prerequisites successfully by tethering, let's install the driver. It can all be done from the terminal!

Type these commands in terminal

git clone https://github.com/lwfinger/rtw89.git
cd rtw89
make
sudo make install
sudo modprobe rtw89pci

Your wireless should now be working.





When Update Manager offers and installs a later kernel version, also known as linux-image, after the requested reboot, you must rebuild the driver:

cd rtw89
make clean
git pull
make
sudo make install
sudo modprobe rtw89pci

Please retain the rtw89pci directory and these instructions for that time.
